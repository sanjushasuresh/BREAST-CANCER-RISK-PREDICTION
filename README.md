This study explores the transformative role of artificial intelligence (AI) in predicting breast cancer risk for the future development of early detection and preventive methodologies. The capabilities of AI in transforming the paradigm on breast cancer screening are explored by constructing a risk prediction model. It aims at the understanding of the role of AI in breast cancer risk prediction and the possible future use of AI in breast cancer diagnosis. Furthermore, the project aims to broaden knowledge on breast cancer survival trends and improve models predicting patient outcomes. The model, through application of advanced statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms, will predict the 10-year mortality risk from breast cancer for patients. The ultimate aim will be to study how AI can improve treatment planning, patient counselling, and overall care management processes incorporated into cancer as a whole. Early findings show improvements in prediction at risk assessment, thus improving accuracy in predictions. It shows clearly that Artificial Intelligence is very effective in tailoring early detections, screening, and final outcomes for patients with breast cancer. Finally, the best selected model had a very good ability to identify probable deaths of patients who died from this disease. Most of the patients who died from the disease can be found very accurately, proven by the high recall value.
